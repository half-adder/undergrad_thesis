\section{Future Directions}

\subsection{Automatic movement detection}

This thesis has focused on the mitigation of the error introduced by inter-frame movement. As noted, not all error can be removed by these methods. As such, it would be useful for an automated classification system to detect inter-frame movement. The fundamental difficulty with this task is that in an experimental setting the image pairs consist of one image at 410 nm and another at 470 nm. Because the excitation spectra of roGFP is different at each wavelength, it is difficult to determine if the differences in each image's intensity profile is due to movement or true biochemical activity.
