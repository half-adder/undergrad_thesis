\section{Definition of Error}
To assess the degree to which changes in the analysis pipeline affect the quality of measurement, a definition of error must first be decided upon. Error ($\epsilon$) is defined to be a function over pharynx space ($p$) which is the difference between the intensity measured in one frame and another. The difference is normalized by the average intensity of the two frames at 410 nm.


\[\epsilon(p) = \frac{I_{410_1}(p) - I_{410_2}(p)}{\frac{I_{410_1}(p) + I_{410_2}(p)}{2}}\]

To calculate redox potentials, we take the first frame at 410 nm and the second at 470 nm. When we quantify error, however, we must use a single wavelength as the changes in emission spectra would confound the errors.

\section{Collection of test data} \label{testCollection}

A large number of technical replicates were collected. A single animal was plated on 5.5 mM levamisole and imaged 57 times in pairs of two images both at 410 nm. A paired-sample t-test indicates no significant difference (p=0.41) between the first and second intensity profile.

\end{figure}

A set of ratiometric images (collection described in \ref{testCollection}) was hand-classified according to the degree of movement (0 - 3) in four regions: the posterior bulb, anterior bulb, sides of the tip, and tip. Figure \ref{fig:RPosteriorMovement} shows the mean $I_{410}/I_{410}$ measured under the midline and colored by degree of movement in the posterior bulb. A ratio of 1 indicates no error.

\section{A partially synthetic data set increases statistical power}

Instead of comparing pairs of measurements taken back-to-back, we can compare all possible pairs. Given n images, we generate ${n \choose 2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}$ pairs. However, repeated excitation seems to attenuate the emission amplitude of the sensor (Figure \ref{fig:AvgIntensityOverTime}). To account for this effect (known as photobleaching) we generate pairs starting at the 15th imaged pair and exclude outliers (Figure \ref{fig:AvgIntensityOverTime}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Figures/rendered_files/photobleaching}

    \caption[Average intensity over time in technical replicates]{The average intensity over time in technical replicates. Red xs mark image pairs excluded from the recombination.}
    \label{fig:AvgIntensityOverTime}
\end{figure}

Since the average time between frames in this synthetic data set is 10 seconds\todo{do this calculation}, there is a large degree of inter-frame movement. Because the true test data has only 12 \todo{real number} pairs which display inter-frame movement, this partially synthetic data set allows us to be more confident about the changes in error seen using different analysis strategies.

\section{Reductions in Manual Intervention}

\subsection{Incorporation of edge information increases segmentation accuracy}

To compare the accuracy of segmentation methods, we first create a "gold-standard" set of images which were segmented by hand to ensure accuracy. The segmentation methods were applied to the same set of images and the resultant masks were compared via the total difference measure described in Yang et al. (A Supervised Approach to the Evaluation of Image Segmentation Methods).
